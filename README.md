My React Shopping Cart App 🛒

Hey there! Welcome to my shopping cart project. This is a small e-commerce app built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Context API. You can browse products, view details, add them to your cart, and adjust quantities — just like a real online store.

How It Works

Imagine you’re visiting your favorite online shop:

Product List

You’ll see all the products neatly displayed in a grid with images, names, and prices.
Click “View Details” to dive deeper into any product.

Product Details

Here you can check out more images, the title, price, and description.
Hit the 🛒 Add to Cart button, and the item is added to your cart.
You can increase the quantity with +, decrease it with -, or remove it completely.
The total updates automatically, giving you a real checkout feel.

Cart Page

All your selected items appear with thumbnails, quantities, and total prices.
You can modify your cart or continue shopping smoothly.
A live order summary on the side keeps track of your total.

How Data Works

Products are fetched from a dummy API: https://dummyjson.com/products
.
React Context handles your cart globally, so it’s available across all pages.
Even if you refresh, your cart stays thanks to LocalStorage.
